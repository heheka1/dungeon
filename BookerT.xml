Booker T.
    Was a practical <rhyme type="a"> man</rhyme>.
He said, Till the soil
And learn from the <rhyme type="a">land</rhyme>.
 <repetition>Let down your bucket
Where you <rhyme type="b">are </rhyme></repetition>.
Your fate is here
And not <rhyme type="b">afar </rhyme>.
To help yourself
And your fellow <rhyme type="c">man</rhyme>,
    <repetition>Train your head,
    Your heart, and your <rhyme type="c">hand</rhyme>.</repetition>
For smartness alone's
Surely not <rhyme type="d">meet</rhyme>—
If you haven't at the same time
Got something to <rhyme type="d">eat</rhyme>.
<event>hus at Tuskegee
He built a <rhyme type="e">school</rhyme></event>
With book-learning there
And the workman's <rhyme type="e">tool</rhyme>.
He started out
In a simple <rhyme type="f">way</rhyme>—
For yesterday
Was not <rhyme type="f">today</rhyme>.
Sometimes he had
Compromise in his <rhyme type="g">talk</rhyme>—
For a man must crawl
Before he can <rhyme type="g">walk</rhyme>—
<event>And in Alabama in '<rhyme type="h">85</rhyme></event>
A joker was lucky
To be <rhyme type="h">live</rhyme>a.
But Booker T.
Was nobody's <rhyme type="i">fool</rhyme>:
You may carve a dream
With an humble <rhyme type="i">tool</rhyme>.
The tallest tower
Can tumble <rhyme type="j">down</rhyme>
If it be not rooted
In solid <rhyme type="j">ground</rhyme>.
So, being a far-seeing
Practical <rhyme type="k">man</rhyme>,
<repetition>He said, Train your head,
    Your heart, and your <rhyme type="k">hand</rhyme>.</repetition>
Your fate is here
And not <rhyme type="l">afar</rhyme>,
<repetition>So let down your bucket
    Where you <rhyme type="l">are</rhyme></repetition>.
