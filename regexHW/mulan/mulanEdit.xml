[Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops</line>
<line> down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands</line>
<line> on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One</line>
<line> grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge</line>
<line> and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Guard <action> [yelling]</action>:  We're under attack!  Light the signal!</line>
 <action></line>
[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long</line>
<line> Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with</line>
<line> his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to</line>
<line> light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at</line>
<line> him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron</line>
<line> lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons</line>
<line> one by one]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Guard <action> [sternly]</action>:  Now all of China knows you're here.</line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu <action> [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]</action>:  Perfect.</line>
 <action></line>
[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li</line>
<line> walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. </line>
<line> He bows, then looks up]</action></line>
</line>
<line> General Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  <action> [The Emperor</line>
<line> motions for Chi Fu's silence]</action></line>
</line>
<line> General Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your</line>
<line> palace immediately.</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor <action> [forcefully]</action>:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu, </line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu:  Yes, your highness.</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up</line>
<line> reserves and as many new recruits as possible.</line>
</line>
<line> General Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip</line>
<line> the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.</line>
 <action></line>
[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the</line>
<line> mound of rice]</action></line>

 <action></line>
[Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist.  She ties a stick</line>
<line> onto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. </line>
<line> She ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother</line>
<line> begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for</line>
<line> Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. </line>
<line> Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse]</action></line>

</line>
<line> Fa Zhou:  Please, PLEASE, help her.</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to</line>
<line> get the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the</line>
<line> bone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the</line>
<line> temple]</action></line>

</line>
<line> Fa Zhou:  Mulan--</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  And three at night. </line>
</line>
<line> Fa Zhou:  Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up--</line>

<line> Bath Lady <action> [poking out of her building]</action>:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? </line>
<line> The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  <action> [She goes back into the building]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for</line>
<line> luck.</line>
</line>
<line> Grandma Fa <action> [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]</action>:  How lucky can they be,</line>
<line> they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  <action> [Speaking to</line>
<line> Cri-Kee]</action>  This is your chance to prove yourself.  <action> [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. </line>
<line> Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Fa Li <action> [excitedly]</action>:  Grandma No!</line>
 <action></line>
[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two</line>
<line> horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other</line>
<line> side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. <action> [Cri-Kee falls over out of</line>

<line> to work with?</line>

</line>

<line> leaving some ink on her hand]</action>  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  <action> [Pushing a</line>

<line> out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa</line>
<line> Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights</line>
<line> incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to</line>
<line> her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and</line>
<line> hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and</line>
<line> takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave</line>
<line> to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries</line>
<line> out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. </line>
<line> Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her</line>
<line> head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes</line>
<line> the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the</line>
<line> stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes</line>
<line> forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out</line>
<line> of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes</line>
<line> one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the</line>
<line> gate and off to camp.]</line>

<line> and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the</line>

[He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury]</action> No.</line>

<line> will disintegrate.</line>
</line>
<line> Ancestor 5:  Not to mention they'll lose the farm.</line>
</line>
<line> Ancestor 1:  My children never caused such trouble.  They all became</line>

<line> soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line</line>
<line> of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who</line>
<line> has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew]</action></line>

</line>
<line> Mulan:  Sorry, <action> [in her man voice]</action> Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.  <action> [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder]</action>  You know how it is</line>

</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]</action>:  His name's Ling.</line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  I didn't ask for his name.  I asked for yours.</line>

</line>
<line> Shang <action> [to the recruits]</action>: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And</line>
<line> tomorrow, the real work begins.</line>
 <action></line>
[All recruits growl at Mulan]</action></line>
</line>

</line>
<line> Mulan:  Am I late?</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [while feeding Mulan]</action>:  No time to talk.  Now remember, it's your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play</line>
<line> nice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt.</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [with her mouth full of food]</action>:  But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  Don't talk with your mouth full.  Now let's see your war face <action> [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]</action>. </line>
<line> I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C'mon scare me, girl! </line>

<line> Are you hungry?</line>
</line>
<line> Yao:  Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  <action> [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with</line>

</line>
<line> Shang <action> [loudly]</action>:  Soldiers!  <action> [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly</line>
<line> impressed by Shang's physique]</action> You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. <action> [Shang walks down the line of soldiers]</action> Anyone who</line>
<line> acts otherwise will answer to me.</line>
</line>
<line> Yao:  Ooooo, tough guy.</line>
</line>
<line> Shang <action> [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]</action>:  Yao.  <action> [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang</line>
<line> Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]</action>  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow.</line>
</line>
<line> Yao <action> [bows to Shang]</action>:  I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.  <action> [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  <action> [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it</line>
<line> high speaking to all the troops]</action>  This represents discipline  <action> [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's</line>
<line> arm with it]</action>  and this represents strength <action> [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while</line>
<line> Mulan looks concerned]</action>.  You need both to reach the arrow.</line>
 <action></line>
[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her</line>

<line> And you haven't got a clue  <action></line>
[Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot.  Mushu</line>

</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [from behind the reeds]</action>:  Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one.  </line>
</line>

</line>
<line> Shang:  They completed their training.</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu:  Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never</line>
<line> see battle.</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [from outside the tent]</action>:  Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war. <action> [to Cri-Kee]</action> This guy's messing with my</line>
<line> plan.</line>
</line>
<line> Shang <action> [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]</action>:  We're not finished.</line>

<line> For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.  <action> [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward]</action></line>

<line> finishes and Mushu takes the paper]</action></line>

<line> Mushu:  Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot</line>
<line> if you'd come and back us up.  <action> [sarcastically]</action>  That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't</line>
<line> mind bringing up some."  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  <action> [Cri-Kee starts</line>

<line> seen a 'black and white' before?</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu:  Who are you?</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  Excuse me!  I think the question is: who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your</line>
<line> hat for that, <action> [the panda starts walking forward]</action> snatch it right off of your head <action> [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper</line>
<line> half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message]</action>.  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on</line>
<line> before I report you.  <action> [the panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight]</action></line>

<line> Chi Fu <action> [calling out from the top of a hill overlooking a valley]</action>:  Captain!  </line>
 <action></line>
[Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen.  Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying face</line>
<line> down, broken cannon carts.  Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley.  Chien-Po</line>
<line> walks up from the valley carrying a helmet]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Chien-po <action> [handing the helmet to Shang]</action>:  ...the General.</line>
 <action></line>
[Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill.  He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright.  He kneels down and</line>

<line> Shang:  The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the</line>
<line> Emperor now.  Move out!</line>

 <action></line>
[Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The</line>
<line> troops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu</line>
<line> points at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shang <action> [angrily]</action>:  What happened?!</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [stumbling]</action>:  Uhhh--</line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the</line>
<line> arrow]</action>  <action> [calling out]</action> Get out of range!!</line>
 <action></line>
[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows</line>
<line> start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  Save the cannons!</line>
 <action></line>
[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him</line>
<line> from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]</action>as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan</line>
<line> free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet</line>
<line> and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  Oh sure, save the horse.</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao,</line>

</line>
<line> Shang:  Fire!</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming</line>
<line> from the mountain position]</action></line>

<line> to fight.  If we die, we die with honor.</line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on</line>

</line>
<line> Shang:  Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.</line>
 <action></line>
[The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow</line>
<line> embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Yao <action> [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]</action>:  Hey.</line>
 </line>
<line> Shang:  Ping, come back.  Ping!</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the</line>

</line>
<line> Shang <action> [starting to run after her waving his arms]</action>:  Stop!</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang]</action></line>
</line>

 <action></line>
[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock]</action></line>
</line>

 <action></line>
[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands</line>
<line> on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]</action>:  You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in</line>
<line> front of you!</line>
 <action></line>
[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and</line>
<line> Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu <action> [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]</action>:  Yrrrrrrraah.  </line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. </line>
<line> Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his</line>
<line> horse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him</line>
<line> around and helping him run away from the avalanche]</action></line>
</line>

<line> around and run back to where they came from]</action>  Waaaaaaaaaa!</line>

[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up</line>
<line> Shan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She</line>

<line> his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he</line>
<line> moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  <action> [Mushu picks</line>

<line> your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go <action> [looking as if he's about to cry]</action>.</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror <action></line>
[picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet]</action> I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  <action> [throws the</line>
<line> helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]</action></line>
</line>

<line> his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]</action>  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean,</line>
<line> you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  <action> [Mulan smiles]</action>.</line>
</line>
<line> Cri-Kee <action> [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]</action>:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl.</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  <action> [Cri-Kee nods]</action> <action> [to Khan]</action>  And what are you? A sheep?</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [sadly]</action>:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home.</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll</line>

</line>
<line> Shang:  You don't belong here Mulan, go home.</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]</action>:  Shang, I saw them in the mountains.  You have to believe me.</line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  Why should I?</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]</action>:  Why else would I come back?  You said you'd trust Ping.  Why is Mulan any different?</line>
 <action></line>
[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward]</action></line>

[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the</line>
<line> sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that</line>
<line> all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's</line>
<line> men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry</line>
<line> the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating</line>

 <action></line>
[Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram.  They are unsuccessful at opening the door.  Mulan sees</line>
<line> what's going on and arrives at the steps]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [to herself]</action>:  They'll never reach the Emperor in time.  <action> [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers.  She</line>
<line> whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]</action>  Hey guys, I've got an idea.  <action> [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards the columns]</action></line>

 <action></line>
[Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling</line>
<line> and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and</line>
<line> prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column</line>
<line> to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together]</action></line>

</line>
<line> Yao <action> [whispering]</action>:  Does this dress make me look fat? <action> [Mulan slaps him]</action>  Ow.</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Hun Archer:  Who's there?</line>
</line>
<line> Hun Bald Man #2 <action> [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]</action>:  Concubines.</line>
</line>
<line> Hun Bald Man #1:  Ugly concubines.</line>
</line>
<line> Ling <action> [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]</action>:  Oh he's so cute.</line>
 <action></line>
[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's</line>
<line> dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shang <action> [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]</action>:  Aww.</line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk.  Mushu from above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]</action>:  Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  <action> [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned</line>
<line> falcon doesn't do anything]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a</line>
<line> woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two</line>
<line> heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing</line>
<line> Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist</line>
<line> at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun</line>
<line> Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach</line>
<line> followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]</action></line>

<line> throat]</action> Bow to me!</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor:  No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.</line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu:  Then you will kneel in pieces. <action> [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with</line>
<line> his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column</line>
<line> and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls</line>
<line> to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over</line>
<line> forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind</line>
<line> as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm</line>
<line> pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the</line>
<line> stairs]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  Chien-Po, get the Emperor.</line>
</line>
<line> Chien-Po <action> [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]</action>:  Sorry, your Majesty.  </line>
 <action></line>
[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in</line>
<line> the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu</line>
<line> watches the Emperor leave]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu:  No! </line>
</line>
 <action> [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and</line>
<line> throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the</line>
<line> edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Yao <action> [motioning her to follow]</action>:  Come on!</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look.  Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope. </line>
<line> Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabs</line>
<line> Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope.  Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the</line>
<line> sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.  The crowd cheers]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu:  No!  <action> [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the</line>
<line> throng of people]</action>  Yrraaaaahhhh!</line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls</line>
<line> out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he</line>
<line> puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away. </line>
<line> Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the</line>
<line> shirt collar]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu <action> [in Shang's face]</action>:  You, you took away my victory.</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet.  Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  No!  I did!  <action> [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu <action> [looking at Mulan]</action>:  The soldier from the mountains.</line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and</line>
<line> through the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right</line>
<line> behind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. </line>
<line> Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse</line>
<line> catches up with Mulan]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  So what's the plan?</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  Ummmm.</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  You don't have a plan?!</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower]</action> go. </line>
<line> Mushu--</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. <action> [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use</line>
<line> the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword</line>
<line> wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. </line>
<line> Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column</line>
<line> causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes</line>
<line> to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to</line>
<line> her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework</line>
<line> lighters) on the edge of the tower]</action> </line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  Citizens, I need firepower.</line>
</line>
<line> Barry Cook:  Who are you?</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]</action>:  You're</line>
<line> worst nightmare.</line>
 <action></line>
[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Man in Crowd #1:  On the roof.</line>
</line>
<line> Man in Crowd #2:  Look!</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks</line>
<line> through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her</line>
<line> person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shan-Yu:  It looks like you're out of ideas.</line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through</line>
<line> the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that</line>
<line> Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping</line>
<line> off the fan with her sword movement]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  Not quite.  <action> [calling out]</action>  Ready, Mushu?</line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]</action>:  I am ready, baby. <action> [He blows fire onto a</line>
<line> stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]</action>  Light me!  <action> [Cri-Kee lights</line>
<line> the fuse]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in</line>
<line> the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and</line>
<line> stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan</line>
<line> lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to</line>
<line> run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly</line>
<line> propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the</line>
<line> rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the</line>
<line> roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [while running]</action>:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.</line>
 <action></line>
[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to</line>
<line> fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs</line>
<line> onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and</line>
<line> releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the</line>
<line> ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mushu <action> [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]</action>:  Ah</line>
<line> ha ha ha ha.  <action> [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him]</action> <action> [to</line>
<line> Cri-Kee]</action>  You are a lucky bug. <action> [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu <action> [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]</action>:  That was a deliberate</line>
<line> attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  <action> [Shang and troops push</line>
<line> Mulan behind them to protect her]</action> <action> [to Shang]</action> Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting.</line>
</line>
<line> Shang <action> [in Chi Fu's face]</action>:  She's a hero.</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu:  'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.</line>
</line>
<line> Shang <action> [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]</action>:  Listen, you pompous--</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor <action> [walking down the steps]</action>:  That is enough!</line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  Your Majesty, I can explain.</line>
 <action></line>
[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear</line>
<line> path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look</line>
<line> waits to write down the words of the Emperor]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Emperor:  I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away</line>
<line> from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,</line>
<line> destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  <action> [the Emperor bows to Mulan]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. </line>
<line> Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing</line>
<line> what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the</line>
<line> ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mushu:  My little baby's all grown up and savin' China.  <action> [to Cri-Kee]</action> You have a tissue?</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor:  Chi Fu,</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu:  Your Excellency?</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor:  See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu <action> [muttering to himself]</action>:  A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]</action></line>
<line> what? <action> [stutters]</action> But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor <action> [to Mulan]</action>:  Very well then, you can have his job <action> [pointing out Chi Fu]</action>.</line>
</line>
<line> Chi Fu <action> [wobbling to and fro]</action>:  What?...My...[faints]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]</action>:  With all due respect, your Excellency.  I</line>
<line> have been away from home long enough.</line>
</line>
<line> Emperor <action> [taking off his pendant]</action>:  Then take this, so your family will know what you have done</line>
<line> for me.  And this <action> [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu]</action>  so the world will know what you have done</line>
<line> for China.</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Yao:  Is she allowed to do that?  <action> [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]</action></line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts</line>
<line> all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground</line>
<line> again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan</line>
<line> starts to smile anticipating something good]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shang:  Um...[Mulan grins]</action>  You... <action> [Mulan smiles]</action> You fight good.</line>
</line>
<line> Mulan <action> [smile turning into disappointment]</action>:  Oh, thank you.  <action> [Mulan walks toward Khan]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Shang: <action> [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]</action>:  Hmm.</line>
 <action></line>
[Mulan mounts Khan]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Mulan:  Khan, let's go home.</line>
 <action></line>
[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground</line>
<line> level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]</action></line>
</line>
<line> Emperor <action> [to Shang]</action>:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.</line>
</line>
