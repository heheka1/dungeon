         <p>Message from xXMidnightEssenceXx: Obviously I did not write this, it was published on
            this site 5 years ago, then removed. There are probably other copies of this on
            FanFiction as well as other sites, but I though I'd post it anyway. Those who remember
            My Immortal well should also remember the first few chapters (1-15) were co-written with
            'Raven' hence they were spelt better etc but don't worry Raven leaves in chapter 16
            (which is where her character Willow gets expelled from Hogwarts). However, she seems to
            return... The copy on here I'm pretty sure is the 100% original version of My Immortal
            with no edits at all outside those by Raven (which were in the original). This version
            will include the 'hacker' chapter 39 and the original chapter 39, and the possibly fake
            "My Immortal 2" if I can find it! I will also include links to the My Immortal "MOVIE"
            and other sites where you can read more at the end. Thank -–or "Fangz"- You!.</p>
         <p>The Return of My Immortal! Excerpt from Encyclopedia Dramatica: My Immortal is the most
            famous, notoriously bad fan fiction ever written. Based very loosely in the Harry Potter
            universe and featuring the blatant Mary-Sue protagonist Ebony (or often times "Enoby")
            Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, it reads like a detailed list of everything a fanfic
            author could ever possibly do wrong, only taken to exaggerated, horrifying extremes.
            Written by super-tard Tara Gilesbie, My Immortal was originally posted to sometime in
            2006, but was subsequently deleted by the staff after causing a severe drop in the
            site's collective IQ. In fact, the fanfic is so unbelievably bad that many refuse to
            accept that it's real, insisting that Tara was only trolling and that the story is
            really a parody. Regardless of the author's intent, My Immortal remains one of the most
            cringe-worthy, unintentionally hilarious, so-bad-it's-good pieces of literature the
            internets have ever shat out.</p>

         <p>Hi my name is <name ref="TG">Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way</name> and I have <rs type="fashion">long ebony black hair <note place="parenthesis">(that's how I got my name)</note> with purple streaks and red tips 
            that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a
            lot of people tell me I look like <name ref="AL">Amy Lee</name></rs> <note place="parenthesis">(AN: if u don't know who she is get da <w norm="swear">hell</w>
               out of here!)</note>. I'm not related to <name ref="GaW">Gerard Way</name> but I wish I was because he's a major
            <rs type="swear">fucking</rs> hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white
            skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm
            in the seventh year <note place="parenthesis">(I'm seventeen)</note>. I'm a goth <note place="parenthesis">(in case you couldn't tell)</note> and I wear
            mostly black. I love <rs type="store">Hot Topic</rs> and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I
            was <rs type ="fashion"> <w norm="wearing">earing</w> a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt,
            pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation,
            black eyeliner and red eye shadow</rs>. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and
            raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me.
            I put up my <rs type="swear">middle finger at them</rs>.</p>
         <p> <said who="Draco">Hey Ebony!</said> shouted a voice. I looked up. It was…. <name ref="DM">Draco Malfoy!</name></p>
         <p><said who="Draco">What's up Draco?</said> I asked. </p>
         <p> <said who="Draco">Nothing</said>. he said shyly. But then, I heard my friends call me and I had to go
            away.</p>

               <w norm ="non goth">preps</w> stop <w norm="insulting">flaming</w> ma story ok!</note> The next day I woke
            up in my bedroom. It was snowing and raining again. I opened the door of my coffin and
            drank some blood from a bottle I had. My coffin was black ebony and inside it was hot
            pink velvet with black lace on the ends. I got out of my coffin and took of my <rs type="fashion"> giant <w norm="My Chemical Romance">MCR</w>
            t-shirt which I used for pajamas</rs>. Instead, I put on a<rs type="fashion"> black leather dress, a pentagram
            necklace, combat boots and black fishnets on. I put on four pairs of earrings in my
            pierced ears, and put my hair in a kind of messy bun.</rs> </p>
         <p> My friend, <name ref="R">Willow </name><note place="parenthesis">(AN: Raven <w norm="this">dis</w> is <w norm="you">u</w>!)</note> woke up then and grinned at me. She flipped her <rs type="fashion">long
            waist-length raven black hair with pink streaks and opened her forest-green eyes. She
            put on her <name ref="BW">Marilyn Manson</name> t-shirt with a black mini, fishnets and pointy high-heeled
               boots. We put on our makeup <note place="parenthesis">(black lipstick white foundation and black eyeliner.)</note> </rs>
         </p>
         <p> <said who="Willow"><rs type="swear"><w norm="Oh My Fucking God">OMFG</w></rs>, I saw you talking to Draco Malfoy yesterday!</said> she
            said excitedly.</p>
         <p><said who="Ebony">Yeah? So?</said> I said, blushing.</p> 
         <p><said who="Willow">Do you like Draco?</said> she asked as we went
            out of the Slytherin common room and into the Great Hall. </p>
         <p><said who="Ebony">No I so <rs type="swear">fucking</rs> don't!</said> I
               shouted. </p>
         <p><said who="Willow">Yeah right!</said> she exclaimed. Just then, Draco walked up to me.</p>
         <p><said who="Draco"> Hi.</said> he said.</p> 
         <p><said who="Ebony">Hi.</said> I replied flirtily. </p>
         <p><said who="Draco">Guess what.</said> he said. </p>
         <p> <said who="Ebony">What?</said> I asked. </p>
         <p><said who="Draco">Well, <rs type="band">Good Charlotte</rs> are having a concert in Hogsmeade.</said> he told me. </p>
         <p> <said who="Ebony">Oh. My. <rs type="swear">Fucking</rs>. God!" I screamed. I
               love <w norm="Good Charlotte">GC</w>. They are my favorite band, besides <rs type="band">MCR</rs>.</said> </p>
         <p> <said who="Draco">Well…. do you want to go with me?</said> he
            asked. I gasped. </p>
